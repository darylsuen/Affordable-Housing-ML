This is an R scipt for exploring the application of ML algorithms to Statistics Canada data to try to predict Dissemination Areas in Vancouver, BC that have relatively high numbers of households suffering from housing affordability issues.
The data suffers from the random rounding that Statistics Canada uses to ensure confidentiality. I suspect a large negative impact on ML model results.
